## Introduction

The flight data of ABIA contains 99,260 itineraris from or to Austin. There are delayed, canceled, or diverted data.
For this analysis, I would like to focus on the cancellation, because the worst option for itinerary must be a cancellation.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# loading packages
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```
```{r}
# import dataset 
ABIA = read.csv("../data/ABIA.csv")
head(ABIA)
```

## Dress data up
I started by dressing data up for better visualization or analysis. For example, I changed Month, day data from numeric to factor and cancellation code. And I made new data frame for checking the departure from or arrival in Austin.
```{r}
ABIA$DOW = cut(ABIA$DayOfWeek, breaks=7, labels=c("MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI", "SAT", "SUN"))
ABIA$MN = cut(ABIA$Month, breaks=12, labels=c("JAN", "FEB", "MAR", "APR", "MAY", "JUN", "JUL", "AUG", "SEP", "OCT", "NOV", "DEC"))
ABIA[ABIA$CancellationCode=='A', 'CC']="carrier"
ABIA[ABIA$CancellationCode=='B', 'CC']="weather"
ABIA[ABIA$CancellationCode=='C', 'CC']="NAS"
ABIA[ABIA$Origin=='AUS', 'FromAUS']=1
ABIA[ABIA$Dest=='AUS', 'FromAUS']=0
```

## Review cancellation rate

The important informaiton about cancellation is not the number of cancellation but the rate of cancellation.
I calculated the rate by dividing cancelled flights by all flights for each case.

### Cancellation rate w.r.t. Month and Day
First, we can see the cancellation rate by Month.It tends to be high in March, April.
```{r}
ABIA_Cc_M = ABIA %>%
  group_by(MN) %>%
  summarize(Cancel_Rate=round(sum(Cancelled==1)/n()*100,digits=2))
ggplot() + geom_col(data=ABIA_Cc_M, aes(x=MN, y=Cancel_Rate))
kable(ABIA_Cc_M, caption="Cancellation Rate by Month")
```

Second, the cancellation rate by Day. It tends to be high on Tuesday.
```{r}
ABIA_Cc_D = ABIA %>%
  group_by(DOW) %>%
  summarize(Cancel_Rate=round(sum(Cancelled==1)/n()*100,digits=2))
ggplot() + geom_col(data=ABIA_Cc_D, aes(x=DOW, y=Cancel_Rate))
kable(ABIA_Cc_D, caption="Cancellation Rate by Day")
```

Third, the cancellation rate by Day and Month. We need to be careful to check the flight plan on weekend in September.
```{r}
ABIA_Cc = ABIA %>%
  group_by(DOW, MN) %>%
  summarize(Cancel_Rate=round(sum(Cancelled==1)/n()*100,digits=2))
ggplot() + geom_col(data=ABIA_Cc, aes(x=DOW, y=Cancel_Rate)) + facet_wrap(~MN, nrow=6)
ABIA_Cc=xtabs(Cancel_Rate ~ DOW + MN, data=ABIA_Cc)
kable(ABIA_Cc, caption="Cancellation Rate by Month and Day")
```


### Cancellation rate w.r.t. carrier

The worst carrier for its flight  cancellation is MQ. However, the number of cancellation is the highest in AA, We will see it later.

```{r}
ABIA_Cc_C = ABIA %>%
  group_by(UniqueCarrier) %>%
  summarize(Cancel_Rate=round(sum(Cancelled==1)/n()*100,digits=2))
ggplot() + geom_col(data=ABIA_Cc_C, aes(x=UniqueCarrier, y=Cancel_Rate))
kable(ABIA_Cc_C, caption="Cancellation Rate by Carrier")
```

### Cancellation rate between departure and arrival

There is no big difference in cancellation rate between departure and arrival. 
```{r}
ABIA_Cc_A = ABIA %>%
  group_by(FromAUS) %>%
  summarize(Cancel_Rate=round(sum(Cancelled==1)/n()*100,digits=2))
ggplot() + geom_col(data=ABIA_Cc_A, aes(x=FromAUS, y=Cancel_Rate))
kable(ABIA_Cc_A, caption="Cancellation Rate for departure and arrival")
```

## Cancellation Reason

The main reasons of cancellation at Austin Airport came from carrier and weather.

```{r}
ABIA_CC = ABIA %>%
  filter(Cancelled==1) %>%
  group_by(CC) %>%
  summarize(Number=n(),Rate=round(n()/length(which(ABIA$Cancelled==1))*100, digits=2))
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data=ABIA_CC, aes(x="", y=Rate, fill=CC), width=1, stat="identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0)
kable(ABIA_CC, caption="Cancellation Reason")
```

- (By Month) Flights cancelled by weather mostly in March and September. As expected, winter weather is not the main reason of cancellation because it is not cold in Austin. Interesting figure is that there were many cancellations by carrier in April.  
```{r}
ABIA_C = subset(ABIA, Cancelled==1)
ggplot() + geom_bar(data=ABIA_C, aes(x=MN, fill=CC))
```

- (By Day) There is no special pattern in cancellation reason and day of week. One thing is that there were many cancellation by NAS on Monday and Tuesday.
```{r}
ggplot() + geom_bar(data=ABIA_C, aes(x=DOW, fill=CC))
```

- (By Carrier) As I mentioned, the number of cancellation of AA is the biggest. However, it might mainly come from its frequent flight, becasue AA's cancellation rate was not high. The thing in this picture is the rate. 9E, YV and OO tend to cancel their flight because of their own problem.
```{r}
ggplot() + geom_bar(data=ABIA_C, aes(x=UniqueCarrier, fill=CC))
```

## Conclusion
If you want to secure your flight, then you had better avoid Tuesday if it is March, Wednesday and Thursday in April, weekends in November. Moreover, you had better avoid MQ, because its rate is extremly high, and YV, 9E, and OO, because their main cancellation reason are themselves.
This is not a sophisticated analysis, just shows rough trend.
